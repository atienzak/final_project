# Defend the Den

My intended final project for PIC 10C would be a game similar to Plants vs. Zombies, in which a player can place defenders along 
a grid-like structure to prevent monsters from destroying the den. There will be five to six (or more) different types of defenders to
make the game more fun (for example, a regular shooter and a wall-like defender that would prevent the monsters from advancing towards
the home for a specific amount of time). Instead of having different levels, it would be set in three difficulties, where the rate of 
monsters coming along would increase as time goes by, with the objective of the game being to hold out as long as the player can.

I intend to use QT for the GUI of the game, and plan to use pixel buffers to make the game look better. I also plan to use concepts in
class, such as properly managing pointers, as my game will include a great amount of moving parts in order to work.
